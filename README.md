- **Ensuring uninterrupted bot operations**: Once a session is generated, it persists across bot restarts, so no re-authentication is required.
- **Seamless bot interactions**: All our bots, whether it's Ernest v2 or Rola v3, depend on this session generator to keep their sessions alive and functioning.
